# Sample NextJS Application with Typeform

This is a sample NextJS application which demonstrates integration of [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/), a paid SAAS tool to create web forms.

## Running

Install dependencies and run the code:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Possibly more instructions are forthcoming.
To integrate your own Typeform forms you'll need to change the code a bit.
